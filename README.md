If you plan to self-host this bot, it's not reccomended but you can try. A mini-tutorial will be added below, but I will not help you with the databases, you need to have adequate knowledge of JavaScript, Eris, and MongoDB (Mongoose). 

## Self-Hosting 
1) Clone the repository 
2) Edit the config.json file with your prefix, id's and etc
3) Make a .env file and put the token in there. 
4) Install all the dependencies 
5) `node .` 

*This is basic, requires some knowledge of coding to do*
